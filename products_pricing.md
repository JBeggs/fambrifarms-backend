# Product Representation and Pricing Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current product database against real-world pricing data from Tshwane Market invoices to identify gaps in product representation and pricing accuracy. The primary goal is to ensure all products have correct representation with packaging sizes embedded in their names for accurate order matching.

## Key Requirements for Product Matching

1. **Quantity**: Only value that can default to 1 when not found
2. **Packaging Size**: Must be saved in product name (e.g., "5kg", "10kg", "500g", "200g", "punnet", "box", "bag")
3. **Correct Representation**: Each product must have its specific packaging variant
4. **Correct Pricing**: Pricing must reflect the actual packaging size

## Current Database Analysis

### Database Statistics
- **Total Products**: 209
- **Unique Base Products**: 101
- **Missing Critical Products**: 5 major items

### Missing Products (Need to Add)
1. **Snap Peas** - Frequently ordered, completely missing
2. **Kiwi** - Need multiple variants:
   - Kiwi (200g punnet)
   - Kiwi (500g punnet) 
   - Kiwi (box)
3. **Blueberry** - Need singular form (we have "Blueberries")
4. **Squash** - Ordered occasionally, missing
5. **Sun Dried Tomatoes** - Ordered occasionally, missing

## Product Representation Issues

### 1. Missing Packaging Size in Product Names
**Current Problem**: Products like "Carrots" don't specify if they're 1kg, 5kg, or 10kg bags.

**Required Fix**: Update product names to include packaging:
- "Carrots" ‚Üí "Carrots (10kg bag)", "Carrots (1kg bag)", "Carrots (bunch)"
- "Potatoes" ‚Üí "Potatoes (10kg bag)", "Potatoes (5kg bag)"
- "Strawberries" ‚Üí "Strawberries (250g punnet)", "Strawberries (500g punnet)"

### 2. Missing Product Variants
**Kiwi Variants Needed**:
- Kiwi (200g punnet) - R25.00
- Kiwi (500g punnet) - R45.00  
- Kiwi (box) - R120.00

**Other Missing Variants**:
- Snap Peas (packet) - R15.00
- Squash (kg) - R30.00
- Sun Dried Tomatoes (packet) - R40.00

### 3. Pricing Discrepancies
**Issues Found**:
- Some products show different prices across invoices
- Unit prices don't always match calculated totals
- Need to standardize pricing per packaging size

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Add Missing Products
```sql
-- Add missing products with proper packaging in names
INSERT INTO products_product (name, unit, price, department_id) VALUES
('Kiwi (200g punnet)', 'punnet', 25.00, 1),
('Kiwi (500g punnet)', 'punnet', 45.00, 1),
('Kiwi (box)', 'box', 120.00, 1),
('Snap Peas (packet)', 'packet', 15.00, 5),
('Squash (kg)', 'kg', 30.00, 5),
('Sun Dried Tomatoes (packet)', 'packet', 40.00, 5);
```

### Phase 2: Update Existing Products
**High Priority Updates**:
1. **Carrots**: Add variants for different bag sizes
2. **Potatoes**: Add variants for different bag sizes  
3. **Onions**: Add variants for different bag sizes
4. **Tomatoes**: Add variants for different packaging
5. **Peppers**: Add variants for different packaging

### Phase 3: Standardize Pricing
1. Review all prices against Tshwane Market data
2. Update prices to reflect current market rates
3. Ensure pricing matches packaging size

### Phase 4: Update Product Matching Logic
1. Enhance parsing to extract packaging size from orders
2. Prioritize exact packaging matches
3. Handle unit compatibility (kg ‚Üî bag, punnet ‚Üî packet)

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing these changes:
- **Better Order Matching**: Orders like "carrots 10kg" will match "Carrots (10kg bag)"
- **Accurate Pricing**: Each packaging variant will have correct pricing
- **Reduced Manual Intervention**: Staff won't need to correct as many mismatches
- **Future-Proof**: System can handle new products with proper packaging representation
