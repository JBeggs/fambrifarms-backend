# Invoice Processing System - Implementation Status

## üéØ SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This system handles the complete workflow from supplier invoice photos to updated product pricing and inventory management. The system is designed to handle the complexity of matching supplier products to our products with proper unit/quantity selections.

## üìã WORKFLOW PHASES

### Phase 1: Invoice Upload ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Button**: "Upload Invoices for Day" in inventory management
- **API**: `POST /api/inventory/upload-invoice/`
- **Models**: `InvoicePhoto` - stores uploaded photos with supplier and date
- **Status Tracking**: Uploaded ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Extracted ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Error

### Phase 2: OCR Processing ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Framework)
- **Command**: `python manage.py process_invoices`
- **Current**: Shows manual OCR instructions (ready for AI integration)
- **Models**: `ExtractedInvoiceData` - stores line items from invoices
- **Data Extracted**: Product code, description, quantity, unit, prices, line totals

### Phase 3: Weight Input & Product Matching üöß PENDING
- **Need**: Interface for Karl to add handwritten weights
- **Need**: Interface for Karl to match supplier products to our products
- **Models**: `SupplierProductMapping` - remembers Karl's decisions ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Phase 4: Stock Processing ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Framework)
- **Button**: "Process Stock Received" (replaces upload button when ready)
- **API**: `POST /api/inventory/process-stock-received/`
- **Logic**: Updates pricing based on Karl's mapping decisions

## üóÉÔ∏è DATABASE MODELS

### InvoicePhoto ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
- supplier (ForeignKey to Supplier)
- invoice_date (DateField)
- uploaded_by (ForeignKey to User)
- photo (ImageField)
- status (uploaded/processing/extracted/completed/error)
- notes (TextField)
```

### ExtractedInvoiceData ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
- invoice_photo (ForeignKey to InvoicePhoto)
- line_number, product_code, product_description
- quantity, unit, unit_price, line_total
- actual_weight_kg (manually added)
- supplier_mapping (ForeignKey to SupplierProductMapping)
```

### SupplierProductMapping ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```python
- supplier, supplier_product_code, supplier_product_description
- our_product (ForeignKey to Product)
- pricing_strategy (per_kg/per_package/per_unit/custom)
- package_size_kg, units_per_package
- created_by (Karl), notes
```

## üîå API ENDPOINTS

### Status Check ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```
GET /api/inventory/invoice-upload-status/
Returns: ready_for_upload | invoices_pending | ready_for_stock_processing
```

### Upload Invoice ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```
POST /api/inventory/upload-invoice/
Body: supplier_id, invoice_date, photo, notes
```

### Process Stock ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```
POST /api/inventory/process-stock-received/
Updates pricing based on completed invoices
```

## üéõÔ∏è MANAGEMENT COMMANDS

### Process Invoices ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```bash
# Process specific invoice
python manage.py process_invoices --invoice-id 123

# Process all pending for supplier
python manage.py process_invoices --supplier "Tshwane Market"

# Process all pending for date
python manage.py process_invoices --date 2025-01-15

# Process all pending
python manage.py process_invoices --all-pending
```

## üß† KARL'S DECISION COMPLEXITY

The system handles Karl's complex product matching decisions:

### Example 1: Loose Carrots
- **Supplier Invoice**: "Carrots 10kg bag" @ R85.00
- **Karl's Decision**: Match to "Carrots (kg)" with `pricing_strategy='per_kg'`
- **Result**: Updates "Carrots (kg)" price to R8.50/kg

### Example 2: Packaged Carrots
- **Supplier Invoice**: "Carrots 2kg bags x5" @ R170.00
- **Karl's Decision**: Match to "Carrots (2kg)" with `pricing_strategy='per_package'`
- **Result**: Updates "Carrots (2kg)" price to R34.00/bag

### Example 3: Tomato Boxes
- **Supplier Invoice**: "Tomatoes 15kg box" @ R450.00
- **Karl's Decision**: Match to "Tomatoes (15kg)" with `pricing_strategy='per_package'`
- **Alternative**: Match to "Tomatoes (kg)" with `pricing_strategy='per_kg'` ‚Üí R30.00/kg

## üöß REMAINING WORK

### High Priority
1. **Weight Input Interface** - Form for Karl to add handwritten weights
2. **Product Matching Interface** - UI for Karl to match supplier products to our products
3. **Unit/Quantity Selection** - UI for Karl to select pricing strategy

### Medium Priority
4. **Flutter Integration** - Upload interface in Flutter app
5. **Stock Quantity Updates** - Update inventory quantities (not just pricing)
6. **Pricing History** - Track pricing changes over time

### Low Priority
7. **AI OCR Integration** - Replace manual OCR with automated extraction
8. **Batch Processing** - Process multiple invoices at once
9. **Reporting** - Invoice processing reports and analytics

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Run Migration**: `python manage.py migrate inventory`
2. **Test Upload**: Use the API endpoints to test invoice upload
3. **Build Weight Input Interface**: Create form for Karl to add weights
4. **Build Product Matching Interface**: Create UI for Karl's mapping decisions
5. **Test Complete Workflow**: End-to-end test with real invoice data

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

- **Flexibility**: System handles loose products, packaged products, and custom units
- **Memory**: `SupplierProductMapping` remembers Karl's decisions for future invoices
- **Pricing Strategies**: Supports per-kg, per-package, per-unit, and custom pricing
- **Status Tracking**: Clear workflow states from upload to completion
- **Error Handling**: Robust error tracking and recovery

The system is now ready for the weight input and product matching interfaces!
