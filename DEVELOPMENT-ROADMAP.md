# üöÄ Fambri Farms Development Roadmap

## üéØ Architecture Philosophy: Backend-Heavy Logic

**Core Principle**: *Business logic lives in the backend; frontend handles presentation and user interaction*

### Why Backend-Heavy?
- **Data Integrity**: Complex business rules enforced at the database level
- **API Consistency**: Multiple frontends (web, mobile, admin) can share the same logic
- **Security**: Sensitive operations (pricing, inventory, supplier selection) controlled server-side
- **Scalability**: Backend logic can be cached, optimized, and scaled independently
- **Auditability**: All business decisions logged and traceable in one place

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Phase 2: System Integration** (Planned)
*Backend systems that coordinate multiple components*

  - Who-did-what-when tracking for orders, POs, production, pricing
  - Admin-level audit queries and exports

- [ ] **Notification Engine** (Backend)
  - Email notifications for PO status, order updates, alerts
  - Webhook system for external integrations
  - SMS notifications for critical alerts (low stock, expiry)

- [ ] **Smart Supplier Assignment** (Backend)
  - Algorithm considering price, availability, lead time, quality rating
  - Fallback logic when preferred suppliers unavailable
  - Cost optimization across multiple suppliers per order

- [ ] **Inventory Automation** (Backend)
  - Automatic stock movements on order confirmation/delivery
  - Integration with production batch completion
  - Stock alert generation (low stock, expiry, reorder points)

---

### üìä **Phase 3: Analytics & Optimization** (Future)
*Backend APIs with lightweight frontend display*

- [ ] **Advanced Reporting API** (Backend)
  - Order analytics (revenue, frequency, seasonal patterns)
  - Supplier performance (delivery times, quality, cost trends)
  - Inventory optimization (turnover, waste, reorder suggestions)
  - Production efficiency (yield analysis, cost breakdowns)

- [ ] **Business Intelligence** (Backend)
  - Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
  - Cost optimization recommendations
  - Supplier relationship scoring
  - Customer behavior analysis

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **Phase 4: Frontend Enhancements** (As Needed)
*UI/UX improvements that support backend functionality*

- [ ] **Admin Dashboard Redesign**
  - Real-time KPI widgets fed by backend APIs
  - PO management interface with bulk actions
  - Production scheduling interface

- [ ] **Customer Experience**
  - Supplier transparency (show which items come from where)
  - Order tracking with estimated delivery times
  - Historical analytics (spending patterns, favorite products)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Backend vs Frontend Decision Framework

### ‚úÖ **Always Backend**
1. **Business Rule Enforcement**
   - Order validation (Monday/Thursday rule, minimum quantities)
   - Pricing calculations (VAT, discounts, supplier markups)
   - Stock availability checks and reservations

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Supplier assignment logic
   - Inventory movements and cost calculations
   - Production yield and cost tracking

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - User permission validation
   - Audit trail generation
   - Financial calculations and invoice generation

4. **System Integration**
   - Automatic PO generation from orders
   - Stock movement automation
   - Email/notification triggers

### üé® **Frontend Only**
1. **User Interface Logic**
   - Form validation (client-side for UX, always re-validated backend)
   - UI state management (cart contents before order submission)
   - Navigation and routing

2. **Presentation Logic**
   - Data formatting and display
   - Sorting and filtering of backend data
   - Component state and interactions

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Hybrid Approach**
1. **Search & Filtering**
   - Backend: Database queries, complex filters, pagination
   - Frontend: UI controls, instant feedback, caching

2. **Order Creation Flow**
   - Backend: Validation, supplier assignment, pricing, final order creation
   - Frontend: Wishlist management, order preview, supplier override interface

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Backend: WebSocket/Server-Sent Events for order status, stock levels
   - Frontend: UI updates, notifications display

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Strategy

### Backend Priority Stack
1. **Django Models & Business Logic** - Core data structures and relationships
2. **Django Signals** - Automatic workflows (stock movements, audit trails)
3. **DRF ViewSets & Serializers** - Consistent API patterns
4. **Celery Background Tasks** - Email notifications, report generation
5. **PostgreSQL Functions** - Complex calculations, data integrity constraints

### Frontend Minimalism
- **Next.js SSR** for SEO and initial load performance
- **React Query** for backend state synchronization
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent, maintainable styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety matching backend API contracts

---

## üìà Success Metrics

### Backend Quality Indicators
- **API Response Times**: < 200ms for CRUD, < 500ms for complex calculations
- **Data Integrity**: Zero manual stock adjustments needed after automation
- **Business Logic Coverage**: 100% of business rules enforced server-side
- **Audit Completeness**: Every critical action logged with full context

### System Integration Success
- **Automated PO Generation**: 95%+ of orders generate POs without manual intervention
- **Stock Accuracy**: Real-time inventory matches physical stock within 2%
- **Notification Reliability**: 100% delivery rate for critical system notifications
- **Cost Calculation Accuracy**: Automated costing within 1% of manual calculations

## üìû Implementation Notes

### Development Flow
1. **Model First**: Define Django models and relationships
2. **Signal Integration**: Add automatic workflows via Django signals
3. **API Design**: Create comprehensive DRF endpoints
4. **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for all business logic
5. **Frontend Integration**: Minimal UI consuming backend APIs
