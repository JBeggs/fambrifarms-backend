# Inventory Receiving Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive inventory receiving workflow that incorporates all validation, tracking, and business rule features implemented in the system.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Pre-Receiving Setup
- **Purchase Order Creation**: Order is placed with supplier through procurement system
- **Expected Delivery**: System tracks expected delivery dates and quantities
- **Receiving Preparation**: Staff prepares receiving area and documentation

### 2. Goods Receipt
When goods arrive, the receiving process begins:

#### A. Initial Verification
- Verify delivery against purchase order
- Check supplier and delivery documentation
- Inspect packaging and overall condition

#### B. Item-by-Item Processing
For each item received:

1. **Product Identification**
   - Scan/enter product SKU or select from list
   - Verify product matches purchase order
   - Check if product exists in system (if not, create new product)

2. **Quantity Verification**
   - Enter received quantity
   - Compare against ordered quantity
   - Flag discrepancies for review

3. **Unit Conversion** (if needed)
   - System detects if supplier unit differs from internal unit
   - Automatic conversion using UnitOfMeasure base_unit_multiplier
   - Display conversion helper: "10 kg = 10000 g"
   - Staff confirms converted quantities

4. **Quality Assessment**
   - Select quality grade: A (Premium), B (Standard), C (Economy), R (Reject)
   - Visual inspection and quality notes
   - Reject items if below acceptable standards

5. **Batch/Lot Tracking** (if required by BusinessSettings)
   - Enter batch/lot number from supplier
   - Record production date (if available)
   - Generate internal batch number if needed

6. **Expiry Date Tracking** (if required by BusinessSettings)
   - Enter expiry date from packaging
   - Calculate shelf life remaining
   - Flag items close to expiry

7. **Price Validation**
   - Enter unit price from invoice
   - System validates against historical prices
   - Price variance analysis:
     - **Within Range**: ≤ max_price_variance_percent (default 20%)
     - **High Variance**: > 20% but ≤ 40% (requires review)
     - **Extreme Variance**: > 40% (requires manager approval)
   - Display price history and recommendations

### 3. Validation and Approval

#### A. Automatic Validations
- **Required Fields**: Batch number, quality grade, expiry date (based on BusinessSettings)
- **Unit Compatibility**: Ensure weight/count unit consistency
- **Quantity Limits**: Check against maximum stock levels
- **Price Thresholds**: Flag prices above approval threshold

#### B. Manager Approval (if required)
- High-value items (above require_price_approval_above threshold)
- Extreme price variances
- Quality grade downgrades
- Significant quantity discrepancies

### 4. Inventory Updates

#### A. Stock Movement Recording
- Create StockMovement record with type 'receipt'
- Update inventory levels:
  - RawMaterial.current_stock_level
  - FinishedInventory.available_quantity
- Record unit costs and total values

#### B. Batch Creation (if applicable)
- Create RawMaterialBatch record
- Link to supplier and purchase order
- Set initial quantities (received = available)
- Record quality grade and dates

#### C. Price History Update
- Create PriceHistory record
- Run price validation analysis
- Create PriceValidationResult
- Flag for review if needed

### 5. Documentation and Reporting

#### A. Receiving Report Generation
- Summary of all items received
- Discrepancies and exceptions
- Quality issues and rejections
- Price variance alerts

#### B. Notifications
- Stock level updates to relevant staff
- Low stock alerts if triggered
- Quality issues to quality control
- Price variance alerts to purchasing

### 6. Integration Points

#### A. Purchase Order Updates
- Mark items as received
- Update received quantities
- Close completed orders

#### B. Supplier Performance
- Track delivery accuracy
- Record quality issues
- Update supplier ratings

#### C. Financial Integration
- Update inventory values
- Create accounts payable entries
- Cost accounting updates

## Business Rules Configuration

All business rules are configurable through BusinessSettings:

### Inventory Defaults
- `default_minimum_level`: Default minimum stock level
- `default_reorder_level`: Default reorder point
- `default_maximum_level`: Default maximum stock level

### Validation Rules
- `max_price_variance_percent`: Maximum acceptable price variance
- `require_price_approval_above`: Price threshold requiring approval
- `min_phone_digits`: Minimum phone number length
- `require_email_validation`: Whether to validate email format

### Tracking Requirements
- `require_batch_tracking`: Mandatory batch/lot numbers
- `require_expiry_dates`: Mandatory expiry date tracking
- `require_quality_grades`: Mandatory quality grade selection

### System Behavior
- `allow_negative_inventory`: Allow overselling
- `auto_create_purchase_orders`: Auto-generate POs for low stock

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Resolutions

1. **Unit Mismatch**
   - Error: "Cannot convert between weight and count units"
   - Resolution: Verify product unit configuration

2. **Missing Batch Number**
   - Error: "Batch/Lot number is required"
   - Resolution: Enter batch number or disable requirement in settings

3. **Extreme Price Variance**
   - Error: "Price variance of 45% requires manager approval"
   - Resolution: Get manager approval or verify pricing

4. **Quality Grade Mismatch**
   - Warning: "Quality grade lower than expected"
   - Resolution: Confirm grade or reject items

### Fallback Procedures

1. **API Connectivity Issues**
   - Display clear error messages
   - Prevent data loss with local validation
   - Retry mechanisms for network issues

2. **Missing Configuration**
   - Use sensible defaults
   - Log configuration issues
   - Alert administrators

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Batch API calls for multiple items
- Cache frequently used data (units, suppliers)
- Lazy load large datasets
- Implement pagination for large receiving sessions

### Monitoring
- Track receiving session duration
- Monitor API response times
- Alert on validation failures
- Dashboard for receiving metrics

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection
- Audit trail for all changes
- User authentication and authorization
- Sensitive data encryption
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Compliance Requirements
- Food safety traceability
- Financial audit trails
- Supplier compliance tracking
- Quality assurance documentation

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Barcode Scanning**: Mobile app integration
2. **Photo Documentation**: Visual quality records
3. **Temperature Logging**: Cold chain monitoring
4. **Automated Alerts**: Real-time notifications
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Receiving performance metrics
6. **Mobile Receiving**: Tablet/phone interface
7. **Integration APIs**: ERP system connections

### Scalability Considerations
- Multi-location support
- Concurrent user handling
- Large volume processing
- Real-time synchronization

## Training and Documentation

### User Training Requirements
- Receiving staff procedures
- Quality assessment guidelines
- System navigation training
- Exception handling procedures

### Documentation Maintenance
- Regular workflow updates
- Business rule changes
- System configuration guides
- Troubleshooting procedures
