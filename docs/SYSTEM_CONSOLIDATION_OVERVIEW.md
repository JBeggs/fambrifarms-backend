## 🔗 **Integration Points & Data Flow**

### **📊 Data Flow Architecture**
```
Invoice Photos → AI OCR → Extracted Data → Weight Input → Product Matching
     ↓              ↓           ↓             ↓              ↓
Supplier Costs → Price Updates → Retail Prices → Order Pricing → Customer Orders
     ↓              ↓           ↓             ↓              ↓
Stock Received → Inventory → SHALLOME Stock → Procurement → External Orders
```

### **🔄 Critical Integration Points**

#### **Invoice → Pricing Integration**
```python
# Invoice processing automatically updates pricing
supplier_price = line_total ÷ actual_weight_kg
retail_price = supplier_price × (1 + business_markup)
product.price = retail_price
```

#### **SHALLOME → Procurement Integration**
```python
# SHALLOME stock feeds procurement decisions
internal_availability = get_shallome_stock(product)
if order_quantity > internal_availability:
    external_needed = order_quantity - internal_availability
    create_procurement_recommendation(product, external_needed)
```

#### **Order → Stock Integration**
```python
# Orders automatically update stock levels
for item in order.items:
    inventory = get_inventory(item.product)
    inventory.quantity_available -= item.quantity
    inventory.save()
```
